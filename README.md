# metagenomics_metatranscriptomics_transcriptomics
a function to generate the hidden layers from the given fasta and the expression files. it takes the replicate columns and then calculates the expression and length as a hidden layer. Applying to the transcriptomics, meta transcriptomics and other expression datasets. It uses expression across the controls and the replicates as weights and you can give a node training additional node based on the relu and the edge nodes. it takes the replicate columns and then calculates the expression and length as a hidden layer.
